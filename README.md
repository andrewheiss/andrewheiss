### Hello there 👋

I’m an assistant professor in the Department of Public Management and Policy at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University. I research nonprofits and NGOs, human rights, public policy/administration, and causal inference.

I teach classes about R, data science, data visualization, and causal inference (as well as non-technical classes on economics nonprofits, and public administration). [All my course materials](https://www.andrewheiss.com/teaching/) are open source, Creative Commons-licensed, and free!

I’m also a [certified RStudio instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/heiss+andrew/) and a [Posit Academy mentor](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/academy/) and absolutely love teaching how to use R and the tidyverse.
